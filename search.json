    "text": "Why Communities?\n\n\n\nImproving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years\n\n\n\n\nI’m probably preaching to the converted in saying that open research is a good thing but you may be wondering what role do communities have to play in open research?\nThis is pyramid diagram is from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and represents how to bring about culture and behaviour change.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.\nBut for this to be effective the user experience of using needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy, from funders and institutions, which define what you have to do within the system to gain recognition.\nThis in term defines the incentives that reward participants for participating in the system.\nWhilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing people undertaking new practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is possible.\nThus communities serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines develop and mature over time.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

    "text": "What are Communities?\n\n“a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared purpose (or multiple overlapping purposes) and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone.”\nCommunity: shared purpose, belonging, culture\n\nI think before going further its worth giving a clear definition of what a community is and this quote from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement encapsulates it nicely…"

There are a lot out of different tools and services out there.\nIt’s therefore not surprising that some people are hesitant to change when presented with the mantra to adopt Open Research as it can be overwhelming."

    "section": "Diffusion of Innovation",
    "text": "Diffusion of Innovation\n\n\nWhen any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after, and following them there is the early majority where uptake increases dramatically. Unfortunately there is still a large proportion of people with varying resilience, the late majority, and some with higher resilience, somewhat unflatteringly termed the laggards but that’s not meant to be disparaging.\nBy normalising open research practices through building an active community we can accelerate and lower the bar for adopting Open Research practices and reach the early and late majority and the stragglers faster.\nAnd I don’t think its about making massive leaps, you don’t have to instantly become an expert in typeseeting LaTeX documents under version control which are compiled into documents and websites automatically and are available in real time. We learn best when we take small steps, one at a time."

    "text": "The Power of Peer-to-Peer\n\nLess intimidating\nExperience &gt; Expertise\nPractical &gt; Theoretical\nSpecificity\nParticipation is the key\n\n\nPeer-to-peer teaching can be far less intimidating than formal teaching environments as it lowers the threshold for asking for help when it is felt that the community is supportive and encouraging.\nVery often experience is more important than expertise. From my own experience knowing a system really well means that you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to understand or use.\nIn a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren’t relevant to someone getting started and only come into play further down the line.\nSpecificity is also important, if you’ve a highly specific question being able to ask someone in your or the wider community is much more likely to result in a relevant answer than having to trawl through a bunch of search results or long detailed documentation.\nBut the key to a successful community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote this."

If you’ve material on Open Research practices, whether that is pre-registration, making your data Open and FAIR, reproducible writing, using the Open Science Framework or anything that you might have shared with colleagues within your team or department please consider sharing it with the wider community within the University.\nThe more people who participate the stronger and more supportive the community will be. And remember the community is self-guiding so its activities and direction are meant to be guided by its members so please consider get involved."
