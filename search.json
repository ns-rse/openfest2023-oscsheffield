You’ll see I’ve also included the link to register at the bottom here and if you decide please do remember to select OSC Sheffield under the Which OSC? field when registering.\nHi, my name is Neil Shephard, and I’m a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the Computer Science Department but I’m not hear today to talk to you about software, but about Open Scholarship Community or OSC in Sheffield."

    "text": "Why Communities?\n\n\n\nImproving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years\n\n\n\n\nI’m probably preaching to the converted in saying that open research is a good thing and funders are increasingly stipulating that the output they fund should be open but what role do communities have to play?\nThis is a diagram from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and represents how to bring about culture and behaviour change.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change and there are systems in place such as the Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point to accelerate communication regardless of publication status. The user interface and experience of using these tools needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services such as GitHub and Docker are integrated.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy, which defines what you have to do within the system and this determines the incentives that reward participants for participating in the system. Increasingly research funders and the University stipulate that research output should be Open.\nWhilst individuals can always got about changing their behaviour themselves, this can be challenging when the culture is to maintain the status quo, as I mentioned I found in the past, and the most effective way of supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as they help normalise the behavioural changes that are being undertaken, provide support and demonstrate that open research is possible, and all of this serves to accelerate the adoption of Open Research practices.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone.”\nCommunity: shared purpose, belonging, culture\n\nI think before going further its worth giving a clear definition of what a community is and this quote from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement encapsulates it nicely…"

There is a lot out there!\nIt’s not surprising that some people are hesitant to change when presented by the vast array of tools and the mantra to adopt Open Research as it can be overwhelming."

    "text": "Diffusion of Innovation\n\n\nWhen any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after, and following them there is the early majority where uptake increases dramatically. Unfortunately there is still a large proportion of people with varying resilience, the late majority, and some with higher resilience, somewhat unflatteringly termed the laggards but that’s not meant to be disparaging.\nBy normalising open research practices through building of an active community we accelerate and lower the bar to adoption of practices and reach the early and late majority and the stragglers faster.\nAnd I don’t think its about making massive leaps, you don’t have to instantly become an expert in typeseeting LaTeX documents under version control which are compiled into documents and websites automatically and are available in real time. We learn best when we take small steps, one at a time."

My current role means I’m more familiar with the FAIR for Research Software and applying them to publishing open source software projects.\nTraining courses are great for getting started but typically when applying what you’ve learned to your own domain/work/situation there will be questions and problems that crop up and this is where the support of a community comes in really helpful as you have a network of people you can contact and ask for help.\nSharing this knowledge directly between researchers so they can learn from each other is a highly effective means of normalising the practices because…when one person teaches two people learn."

    "text": "The Power of Peer-to-Peer\n\nLess intimidating\nExperience &gt; Expertise\nPractical &gt; Theoretical\nSpecificity\nParticipation is the key\n\n\nPeer-to-peer teaching can be far less intimidating than formal teaching environments as it lowers the threshold for asking for help when it is felt that the community is supportive and encouraging.\nVery often experience is more important than expertise. From my own experience knowing a system really well means that you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to understand or use.\nIn a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren’t relevant to someone getting started and only come into play further down the line.\nSpecificity is also important, if you’ve a highly specific question being able to ask someone in your or the wider community is much more likely to result in a relevant answer than having to trawl through a bunch of search results or long detailed documentation.\n\n\n\nThe key to a successful community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote this."

If you’ve material on Open Research practices, whether that is pre-registration, making your data Open and FAIR, reproducible writing, using the Open Science Framework or anything that you might have shared with colleagues within your team or department please consider sharing it with the wider community within the University.\nThe more people who participate the stronger and more supportive the community will be.
