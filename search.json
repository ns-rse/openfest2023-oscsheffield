You’ll see I’ve also included the link to register at the bottom here and if you decide please do remember to select OSC Sheffield under the Which OSC? field when registering.\nHi, my name is Neil Shephard, and I’m a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the Computer Science Department but I’m not hear today to talk to you about software, but about Open Scholarship Community or OSC in Sheffield.\nI’ve in various roles at different Universities over the years as a Genetics Statistician at University of Manchester, Western Australia and went full circle coming back to University of Sheffield. I then spent the best part of a decade working as a Medical Statistician in the Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry before returning to University of Sheffield last year to my current role as Research Software Engineer.\nEarly in my time at Manchester I developed an interest in computational reproducibility of the work I was takin as it streamlined the workflow and is fundamental to the robustness of research.\nDespite being co-author on a number of papers that are Open Access very little of the code that underpinned the research was never formally published and all of the papers were authored in Word, I just couldn’t convince my collaborators to change their workflows to make them more reproducible and open.\nI think its great to see the changes since then and the increasing prominence and importance of Open Research practices as they underpin the validity of research."

I was asked to look into and grow the the RSE community in Sheffield and came across the INOSC Incubator Programme which sounded like a really good way to learn about how to grow communities. There was a specific purpose to incubate a community though which was to seed, nurture and help grow Open Scholarship/Science Communities around the world by helping other researchers to establish local communities and share their resources, ideas and experiences.\nAfter meeting regularly with nine other researchers from Greece, Portugal, France and Germany as well as Durham in the UK for several months we were guided through the process of establishing Open Scholarship Communities by Loek Brinkman and Anita Eereland who you will hear from in a little while.\nAnd so I’m now here to tell you about and launch OSC Sheffield.\n\n\n\nSyllabus v1.2"

    "text": "Why Communities?\n\n\n\nImproving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years\n\n\n\n\nI’m probably preaching to the converted in saying that open research is a good thing and funders are increasingly stipulating that the output they fund should be open but what role do communities have to play?\nThis is a diagram from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and represents how to bring about culture and behaviour change.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change and there are systems in place such as the Open Science Framework and Octopus which is being developed by JISC. Both of which allow (or will) researchers to register their studies, share materials and data (optionally protecting sensitive data) and share outcomes at any point in the study to accelerate communication regardless of publication status. The user interface and experience of using these tools needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services such as GitHub and Docker are integrated.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy, which defines what you have to do within the system and this determines the incentives that reward participants for participating in the system. Increasingly research funders and the University stipulate that research output should be Open.\nWhilst individuals can always got about changing their behaviour themselves, this can be challenging when the culture is to maintain the status quo, as I mentioned I found in the past, and the most effective way of supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as they help normalise the behavioural changes that are being undertaken, provide support and demonstrate that open research is possible, and all of this serves to accelerate the adoption of Open Research practices.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone.”\nCommunity: shared purpose, belonging, culture\n\nI think before going further its worth giving a clear definition of what a community is and this quote from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement encapsulates it nicely.."

There is a lot out there!\nIt’s not surprising that some people are hesitant to change when presented by the vast array of tools and the mantra to adopt Open Research as it can be overwhelming."

    "text": "Diffusion of Innovation\n\n\nWhen any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after, and following them there is the early majority where uptake increases dramatically. Unfortunately there is still a large proportion of people who have a propensity to resist change, some have low resistance, termed here the late majority, some with higher resilience, somewhat unflatteringly termed the laggards but that’s not meant to be disparaging, we want lower the barrier for adoption to everyone.\nBy normalising open research practices through building of an active community we accelerate and lower the bar to adoption of practices and reach the early and late majority and the stragglers faster.\nAnd I don’t think its about making massive leaps, you don’t have to instantly become an expert in typeseeting LaTeX documents under version control which are compiled into documents and websites automatically and are available in real time. We learn best when we take small steps, one at a time."

My current role means I’m more familiar with the FAIR for Research Software and applying them to publishing open source software projects.\nTraining courses are great for getting started but typically when applying what you’ve learned to your own domain/work/situation there will be questions and problems that crop up and this is where the support of a community comes in really helpful as you have a network of people you can contact and ask for help.\nSharing this knowledge directly between researchers so they can learn from each other is a highly effective means of normalising the practices because…when one person teaches two people learn."

    "text": "The Power of Peer-to-Peer\n\nLess intimidating\nExperience &gt; Expertise\nPractical &gt; Theoretical\nSpecificity\nParticipation is the key\n\n\nPeer-to-peer teaching can be far less intimidating than formal teaching environments as it lowers the threshold for asking for help when it is felt that the community is supportive and encouraging.\nVery often experience is more important than expertise. From my own experience knowing a system really well means that you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to understand or use.\nIn a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren’t relevant to someone getting started and only come into play further down the line.\nSpecificity is also important, if you’ve a highly specific question being able to ask someone in your or the wider community is much more likely to result in a relevant answer than having to trawl through a bunch of search results or long detailed documentation.\n\n\n\nThe key to a successful community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote this."

Members in specific domains are better positioned to engage with and inspire their peers. It is important to have representatives from all faculties to encourage wide-spread adoption and avoid any one group from feeling excluded or that Open Scholarship isn’t for them. I’ve reached out to members of the Open Research Working Group here at the University of Sheffield and have representatives from most faculties but if you would like to be involved please do get in touch.\nThe community is meant to be an independent, bottom-up, self-governing and self-steering group and not determined by institutional policies but should cooperate with the existing structures for Open Research such as the excellent resources and meetings put on by Jenni Adams and her colleagues in the library, the Open Research Working Group who have regular drop-in sessions. There is also the Data Visualisation Hub who help with analytical aspects and the RSE team which I’m a part of who together with IT services run Code Clinics and Lunch Bytes.\nIts aimed at all staff, not just researchers but support staff and administrators."

Jenni Adams, the library Open Research Manager and organised or OpenFest2023, organises the monthly Open Research Conversations which are lunchtime seminars open to all where typically two speakers discuss particular issues in open research followed by discussion.\nAdam Partridge runs monthly drop-in sessions for those engaged in and interested in Open Research to discuss topics.\nIn the past Zuzzana XXX and Jim Uttley have organised local Reproducibilitea Journal Clubs where specific research articles covering Open Research practices or examples of papers where such practices were discussed. These tailed off around the pandemic but Zuzzana, Jim and myself are rejuvenating them and it would be great to have anyone interested in learning more attending these.\nSimilarly there used to be the Sheffield R User Group which met to showcase using the R statistical software and associated ecosystem for undertaking reproducible research. The frequency of these meetings varied but again tailed off and haven’t been run. Myself and Grace Accad of the Data Visualisation and Analysis Team are getting these back up and running with a relaunch scheduled for October. We’d be keen to hear from you if you use R and have some work you would like to present, but we’ll have regular slots on using Quarto for different aspects of open research.\nMost importantly though the community is shaped by you, if you’ve an interest or need to know more about a particualr subject please come and join the community. If you’ve material on Open Research practices, whether that is pre-registration, making your data Open and FAIR, reproducible writing, using the Open Science Framework or anything that you might have shared with colleagues within your team or department please consider sharing it with the wider community within the University.\nThe more people who participate the stronger and more supportive the community will be. And remember the community is self-guiding so its activities and direction are meant to be guided by its members so please consider get involved."
