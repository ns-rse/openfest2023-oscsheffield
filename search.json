If you decide to register with OSC Sheffield you can do so at the address on the bottom left but please make sure you select OSC Sheffield under the Which OSC? field when registering.\nHi, my name is Neil Shephard, and I’m a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the Computer Science Department. I’m not hear today to talk to you about software, but about Open Scholarship Community or OSC in Sheffield.\nI completed both undergraduate and post-graduate degrees here in Sheffield. I’ve worked as a Genetics Statistician at University of Manchester, Western Australia and went full circle coming back to University of Sheffield. I then spent the best part of a decade working as a Medical Statistician in the Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry before returning to University of Sheffield last year to my current role as Research Software Engineer.\nEarly in my time at Manchester I developed an interest in reproducibility as I quickly tired of re-creating tables and copying and pasting figures into documents for internal reports and publications and taught myself literate programming with LaTeX and in time other systems. When I switched to using R for medical statistics I also learnt how to use Git to version control my code.\nDespite being co-author on a number of papers that are Open Access during my time working as a Medical Statistician the code that underpinned the research was never formally published and all of the papers were authored in Word.\nI think its great to see the changes since then and the increasing prominence and importance of Open Research practices as they underpin the validity of research.\nI’m passionate about open research as it is fundamental and underpins the enquiry process, but I came to be here stood in front of you almost by accident. I was asked to grow the the RSE community in Sheffield and came aross the INOSC Incubator Programme which sounded like a really good way to learn about how to grow communities. But it had a specific purpose which I hadn’t clocked from the title which was to incubate a community and as a consequence I’m now stood in front of you today to tell you a bit about what I’ve learned and invite you to join the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield."

I had been asked to look into growing the RSE community within Sheffield when earlier this year I saw the OSC Incubator Programme was running and decided to sign up."

    "text": "Why Communities?\n\n\n\nBut Why Communities? We all know that open science is a good thing and funders are increasingly stipulating that the output they fund should be open. This is a diagram from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and represents how to bring about culture and behaviour change.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change and there are systems in place such as the Open Science Framework and Octopus which is being developed by JISC. Both of which allow (or will) researchers to register their studies, share materials and data (optionally protecting sensitive data) and share outcomes at any point in the study to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.\nThe user interface and experience of using these tools needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services such as GitHub and Docker are integrated.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy, which you are all involved in and incentives which address the reward system and these are changing towards incentivising open research practices.\nBut we’re not there yet as these practices are not the norm within many places and it is communities that help bridge or fill this gap. Because when people see others undertaking and engaging with open research practices in a visible manner it helps accelerate adoption.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

    "text": "What are Communities?\n\n“a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared purpose (or multiple overlapping purposes) and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone.”\nCommunity: shared purpose, belonging, culture\n\nI think before going further its worth defining what a community is and this quote from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement gives a clear definition."

    "text": "Diffusion of Innovation\n\n\nWhen any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after, and following them there is the early majority where uptake increases dramatically. Unfortunately there is still a large proportion of people who have a propensity to resist change, some have low resistance, termed here the late majority, some with higher resilience, somewhat unflatteringly termed the laggards.\nBy normalising open research practices through building of an active community we accelerate and lower the bar to adoption of practices and reach the early and late majority and the stragglers faster.\nAnd I don’t think its about making massive leaps"

From my own experience knowing a system really well means that you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to understand or use.\nIn a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren’t relevant to someone getting started and only come into play further down the line.\nIn the same vein the more specific a topic is the better, it ensures that the necessary detail is covered and that it is relevant to those attending which improves engagement.\n\n\n\nThe key to a successful community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote this."

Jenni Adams, the library Open Research Manager and organised or OpenFest2023, organises the monthly Open Research Conversations which are lunchtime seminars open to all where typically two speakers discuss particular issues in open research followed by discussion.\nAdam Partridge runs monthly drop-in sessions for those engaged in and interested in Open Research to discuss topics.\nIn the past Zuzzana XXX and Jim Uttley have organised local Reproducibilitea Journal Clubs where specific research articles covering Open Research practices or examples of papers where such practices have been used were run. These tailed off around the pandemic but we will be rejuvenating them.\nSimilarly there used to be the Sheffield R User Group which met to showcase using the R statistical software and associated ecosystem for undertaking reproducible research. The frequency of these meetings varied but again tailed off and haven’t been run. Myself and Grace Accad of the Data Visualisation and Analysis Team are getting these back up and running with a relaunch scheduled for October. We’d be keen to hear from you if you use R and have some work you would like to present, but we’ll have regular slots on using Quarto for different aspects of open research.\nMost importantly though the community is shaped by you, if you’ve an interest or need to know more about a particualr subject please come and join the community. If you’ve material on Open Research practices, whether that is pre-registration, making your data Open and FAIR, reproducible writing, using the Open Science Framework or anything that you might have shared with colleagues within your team or department please consider sharing it with the wider community within the University. The communities activities and direction are meant to be guided by its members so please get involved."
