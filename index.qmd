Thank you for the introduction Ric and good afternoon to you all.

If you'd like to view these slides, which I've littered with links, then if you're quick you can scan the QR code or the
URL is at the bottom of every slides along with a link to register with OSC Sheffield if you're really keen to do so.

Hi, my name is Neil Shephard, and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the
Computer Science Department but I'm not hear today to talk to you about software, but about Open Scholarship Community or
OSC in Sheffield.

<!-- I've in various roles at different Universities over the years as a Genetics Statistician at University of Manchester, -->
<!-- Western Australia and went full circle coming back to University of Sheffield. I then spent the best part of a decade -->
<!-- working as a Medical Statistician in the Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry -->
<!-- before returning to University of Sheffield last year to my current role as Research Software Engineer. -->

<!-- Early in my time at Manchester I developed an interest in computational reproducibility of the work I was takin as it -->
<!-- streamlined the workflow and is fundamental to the robustness of research. -->

<!-- Despite being co-author on a number of papers that are Open Access very little of the code that underpinned the research -->
<!-- was never formally published and all of the papers were authored in Word, I just couldn't convince my collaborators to -->
<!-- change their workflows to make them more reproducible and open. -->

<!-- I think its great to see the changes since then and the increasing prominence and importance of Open Research practices -->
<!-- as they underpin the validity of research. -->

<!-- How did I come to be here talking to you about Open Scholarship Communities though? -->

<!-- In short it was bit of an accident. I was asked to look into and grow the the RSE community in Sheffield and came across -->
<!-- the INOSC Incubator Programme which sounded like a really good way to learn about how to grow communities. There was a -->
<!-- specific purpose to incubate a community though which was to seed, nurture and help grow Open Scholarship/Science -->
<!-- Communities around the world by helping other researchers to establish local communities and share their resources, -->
<!-- ideas and experiences. -->

<!-- After meeting regularly with nine other researchers from Greece, Portugal, France and Germany as well as Durham in -->
<!-- the UK for several months we were guided through the process of establishing Open Scholarship Communities by Loek -->
<!-- Brinkman and Anita Eereland who you will hear from in a little while. -->

<!-- And so I'm now here to tell you about and launch OSC Sheffield. -->

## Why Communities?


![[Improving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years](https://www.cos.io/blog/cos-celebrates-10-years)](img/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model2.png){width=75%}

::: {.notes}
<!-- I'm probably preaching to the converted in saying that open research is a good thing but you may be wondering what role -->
<!-- do communities have to play in open research? -->

A common theme throughout today's talks has been that working together, collaborating and sharing experiences is key to
the success of Open Research endeavour and this is where the idea of communities are important.

This diagram is from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and
represents how to bring about culture and behaviour change.

Infrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the
Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point
to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.

But for this to be effective the user experience needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many
popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible.

From the top of the pyramid is policy, which derives from funders and institutions, and defines what you have to do
within the system to gain recognition.

This in turn defines the incentives that reward participants for participating in the system.

Whilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is
to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of
supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others
using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is
possible.

Thus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research
practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines
develop and mature over time.

## What are Communities?

<!-- . . . -->

"_a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared purpose (or multiple overlapping purposes)
  and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of
  belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members
  able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone._"

[Community: shared purpose, belonging, culture](https://www.cscce.org/glossary/community-shared-purpose-belonging-culture/)

::: {.notes}
I think before going further its worth giving a clear definition of what a community is and this quote from the Center
for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement encapsulates it nicely, and a community is...

:::
<!-- + Shared Goals -->
<!-- + Sense of Belonging -->
<!-- + Connections -->
<!-- + Opportunity -->

::: {.notes}
Nurturing a community within Sheffield and as part of the wider International community...

+ Brings together people with shared goals.
+ Gives them a sense of belonging.
+ Allows people to make connections and network.
+ This gives them opportunities to learn and grow.

...all of which helps normalise practices and drives the cultural shift to adopting Open Research and greater
transparency. And if we work together than as a group we can bring about more change than any one individual could
acting on their own.

## Open Science Tools

![[https://101innovations.wordpress.com/](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/)](img/open_science_tools.png){width=75%}

::: {.notes}
As I'm sure most of you are aware, there are a _lot_ of tools out there these days for undertaking open research,
and this graphic shows just some of the tools available.

Services like Research Gate, PLOS One, F1000, pre-print servers, R, Python, BioConductor, Overleaf, Zotero, LaTeX, Git,
and GitHub to name a few on this graphic. There are a lot out of different tools and services out there.

It's therefore not surprising that some people are hesitant to change when presented with the mantra to adopt Open
Research as it can be overwhelming.
:::

## Diffusion of Innovation

![](img/diffusion_innovation.png)

::: {.notes}
When any new innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of
diffusion where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon
after, and following them there is the early majority where uptake increases dramatically. Unfortunately there is still
a large proportion of people with varying resilience, the late majority, and some with higher resilience, somewhat
unflatteringly termed the laggards but that's not meant to be disparaging.

By normalising open research practices through building an active community we can accelerate and lower the bar for
adopting Open Research practices and reach the early and late majority and the stragglers faster.

And I don't think its about making massive leaps, you don't have to instantly become an expert in typeseeting LaTeX
documents under version control which are compiled into documents and websites automatically and are available in real
time. We learn best when we take small steps, one at a time.

## Connecting People

+ Varying career stages
+ Range of skills/knowledge/experience.
+ Support beyond training courses.
+ Sharing knowledge between researchers to learn from each other.

. . .

_When one person teaches, two people learn._


::: {.notes}
The University comprises a range of researchers in terms of career stages, early, mid and advanced

Across each of these there is variation in the skills, knowledge and experience around the different areas of Open
Science, some people have experience in pre-registering study protocols, others are familiar with the FAIR Principles
for Data sharing and might have experience using University of Sheffields ORDA system.

Training courses are great for getting started but typically when applying what you've learned to your own
work or situation there will be questions and problems that crop up and this is where the support of a community
comes in really helpful as you have a network of people you can contact and ask for help.

Sharing this knowledge directly between researchers so they can learn from each other is a highly effective means of
normalising the practices because...when one person teaches two people learn.

## The Power of Peer-to-Peer

+ Less intimidating
+ Experience > Expertise
+ Practical > Theoretical
+ Specificity
+ Participation is the key

::: {.notes}
And so communities ar really about peer-to-peer interactions which are a powerful learning tool.

It can be far less intimidating than formal teaching environments as it lowers the threshold for asking for help when it
is felt that the community is supportive and encouraging.

Very often experience is more important than expertise. From my own experience knowing a system really well means that
you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to
understand or use.

In a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical
explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren't relevant to
someone getting started and only come into play further down the line.

Specificity is also important, if you've a highly specific question being able to ask someone in your or the wider
community is much more likely to result in a relevant answer than having to trawl through a bunch of search results or
long detailed documentation.

But the key to a successful community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote
this.

As your all no doubt aware and have heard today there are already a number of community activities in Sheffield.

The Open Research Working Group convenes regularly to discuss and progress issues surrounding open research within the
University and hold regular drop-in sessions to discuss aspects of Open Research.

Jenni Adams, who has orchestrated this event, also organises monthly Open Research
Conversations which are lunchtime seminars open where invited speakers give short talks on specific topics which are
followed by discussion.

In the past Sheffield had Reproducibilitea Journal Clubs organised which affords an
opportunity to review and discuss different aspects of Open Research.

Similarly there used to be the Sheffield R User Group which met to regularly to share experiences of using the R
statistical software ecosystem for undertaking reproducible research.

Both of these groups are being restarted so keep an eye out for announcements for these launching in October and
November.

Most importantly though the community is shaped by you, if you've an interest or need to know more about a particualr
subject please come and join the community. If you've material on Open Research practices, that you might have shared
with colleagues within your team or department please consider sharing it with the wider community within the
University.

Whether that is that is pre-registration, making your data Open and FAIR, reproducible writing, using the Open Science
Framework or anything else related to Open Research please come and share it with others.

The more people who participate the stronger and more supportive the community will be. And remember the community is
self-guiding so its activities and direction are meant to be guided by its members so please consider get involved.

::: {.notes}

OSC Sheffield isn't an original idea of mine, rather it joins the growing International Open Science and Scholarship
Community (INOSC) which started in the Netherlands but is expanding thanks to the Incubator Programme they established
and which has guided us the development of OSC Sheffield.

I'm pleased to be able to introduce one of the founders of INOSC Anita Eerland from the University of Radboud in The
Netherlands to tell you a little bit more about INOSC and how Sheffield fits in with the wider international community.
