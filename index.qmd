I've also included the link to register at the bottom here and if you decide please do remember to select *OSC
Sheffield* under the *Which OSC?* field when registering.

Hi, my name is Neil Shephard, and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Research Software Engineering Team within the
Computer Science Department but I'm not hear today to talk to you about software, but about Open Scholarship Community or
OSC in Sheffield.

I've in various roles at different Universities over the years as a Genetics Statistician at University of Manchester,
Western Australia and went full circle coming back to University of Sheffield. I then spent the best part of a decade
working as a Medical Statistician in the Clinical Trials Unit within ScHARR. I had a few years working in industry
before returning to University of Sheffield last year to my current role as Research Software Engineer.

Early in my time at Manchester I developed an interest in computational reproducibility of the work I was takin as it
streamlined the workflow and is fundamental to the robustness of research.

Despite being co-author on a number of papers that are Open Access very little of the code that underpinned the research
was never formally published and all of the papers were authored in Word, I just couldn't convince my collaborators to
change their workflows to make them more reproducible and open.

I think its great to see the changes since then and the increasing prominence and importance of Open Research practices
as they underpin the validity of research.

## OSC Incubator Programme

+ Nurture and grow Open Science/Scholarship Communities around the world.
+ Help others establish communities.
+ Share resources, ideas and experience.

How did I come to be here talking to you about Open Scholarship Communities though?

In short it was bit of an accident. I was asked to look into and grow the the RSE community in Sheffield and came across
the INOSC Incubator Programme which sounded like a really good way to learn about how to grow communities. There was a
specific purpose to incubate a community though which was to seed, nurture and help grow Open Scholarship/Science
Communities around the world by helping other researchers to establish local communities and share their resources,
ideas and experiences.

After meeting regularly with nine other researchers from Greece, Portugal, France and Germany as well as Durham in
the UK for several months we were guided through the process of establishing Open Scholarship Communities by Loek
Brinkman and Anita Eereland who you will hear from in a little while.

And so I'm now here to tell you about and launch OSC Sheffield.

## Why Communities?


![[Improving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years](https://www.cos.io/blog/cos-celebrates-10-years)](img/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model2.png){width=75%}

::: aside
[Nosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change](https://www.cos.io/blog/strategy-for-culture-change)
:::

::: {.notes}
I'm probably preaching to the converted in saying that open research is a good thing and funders are increasingly
stipulating that the output they fund should be open but what role do communities have to play?

This is a diagram from an article by Brian Nosek, one of the co-founders of the Center for Open Science and represents
how to bring about culture and behaviour change.

Infrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change and there are systems in place such as the
Open  Science Framework and Octopus which is being developed by JISC. Both of which allow (or will) researchers to
register their studies, share materials and data (optionally protecting sensitive data) and share outcomes at any point
in the study to accelerate communication regardless of publication status. The user interface and experience of using
these tools needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services such as GitHub and Docker are
integrated.

From the top of the pyramid is policy, which defines what you have to do within the system and this determines the
incentives that reward participants for participating in the system. Increasingly research funders and the University
stipulate that research output should be Open.

Whilst individuals can always got about changing their behaviour themselves, this can be challenging when the culture is
to maintain the status quo, as I mentioned I found in the past, and the most effective way of supporting and nurturing
individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as they help normalise the behavioural changes that
are being undertaken, provide support and demonstrate that open research is possible, and all of this serves to
accelerate the adoption of Open Research practices.

## What are Communities?

. . .

"_a dynamic, social grouping where members align around a shared purpose (or multiple overlapping purposes)
  and participate in a shared culture. Active community participation frequently aligns with a sense of
  belonging and affiliation to the community. In a community the flow of information is multi-directional with members
  able to do something as a result of being connected to one another that they would not be able to do alone._"

[Community: shared purpose, belonging, culture](https://www.cscce.org/glossary/community-shared-purpose-belonging-culture/)

::: {.notes}
I think before going further its worth giving a clear definition of what a community is and this quote from the Center
for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement encapsulates it nicely..

<!-- + Shared Goals -->
<!-- + Sense of Belonging -->
<!-- + Connections -->
<!-- + Opportunity -->

::: {.notes}
Nurturing a community within Sheffield and as part of the wider International community...

+ Brings together people with shared goals.
+ Gives them a sense of belonging.
+ Allows people to make connections and network.
+ This gives them opportunities to learn and grow.

...all of which encourages and enables people to take action, normalising practices and achieving more than they might
have on their own, and accelerates the cultural shift to adopting Open Research and greater transparency.

## Open Science Tools

![[https://101innovations.wordpress.com/](https://101innovations.wordpress.com/)](img/open_science_tools.png){width=75%}

::: {.notes}
As I'm sure most of you are aware, there are a _lot_ of tools out there these days for undertaking open research,
sometimes it can be a little overwhelming.

They can be categorised into the areas of Assessment, Discovery, Analysis, Writing, Publication and Outreach and many of
them span several of these areas but we have tools and services like Research Gate, PLOS One, F1000, pre-print servers
like arXiv, bioRxiv and  medRxiv, R, Python, BioConductor, Overleaf, Zotero, LaTeX, Git, GitHub and GitLab. There is a
lot out there!

It's not surprising that some people are hesitant to change when presented by the vast array of tools and the mantra to
adopt Open Research as it can be overwhelming.
:::

## Diffusion of Innovation

![](img/diffusion_innovation.png)

::: {.notes}
When any innovative technology or practice comes along you will typically encounter this sort of pattern of diffusion
where there are a few innovators who develop the system, slightly more early adopters will pick things up soon after,
and following them there is the early majority where uptake increases dramatically. Unfortunately there is still a large
proportion of people who have a propensity to resist change, some have low resistance, termed here the late majority,
some with higher resilience, somewhat unflatteringly termed the laggards but that's not meant to be disparaging, we
want lower the barrier for adoption to everyone.

By normalising open research practices through building of an active community we accelerate and lower the bar to
adoption of practices and reach the early and late majority and the stragglers faster.

And I don't think its about making massive leaps, you don't have to instantly become an expert in typeseeting LaTeX
documents under version control which are compiled into documents and websites automatically and are available in real
time. We learn best when we take small steps, one at a time.

## Connecting People


+ Varying career stages
+ Range of skills/knowledge/experience.
+ Support beyond training courses.
+ Sharing knowledge between researchers to learn from each other.

. . .

_When one person teaches, two people learn._


::: {.notes}
The University comprises a range of researchers in terms of career stages, early, mid and advanced and across each of
these there is variation in the skills, knowledge and experience around the different areas of Open Science, some people
have experience in pre-registering study protocols, others are familiar with the FAIR Principles for Data sharing and
might have experience using University of Sheffields ORDA system. My current role means I'm more familiar with the FAIR
for Research Software and applying them to publishing open source software projects.

Training courses are great for getting started but typically when applying what you've learned to your own
domain/work/situation there will be questions and problems that crop up and this is where the support of a community
comes in really helpful as you have a network of people you can contact and ask for help.

Sharing this knowledge directly between researchers so they can learn from each other is a highly effective means of
normalising the practices because...when one person teaches two people learn.

## The Power of Peer-to-Peer

+ Less intimidating
+ Experience > Expertise
+ Practical > Theoretical
+ Specificity
+ Participation is the key

::: {.notes}
Peer-to-peer teaching can be far less intimidating than formal teaching environments as it lowers the threshold for
asking for help when it is felt that the community is supportive and encouraging.

Very often experience is more important than expertise. From my own experience knowing a system really well means that
you can often overlook certain aspects that you take for granted and that someone new to a system might struggle to
understand or use.

In a similar vein sharing practical experience of how to use tools is often more beneficial than deep theoretical
explanations. There can often be many aspects that might be covered in theoretical material that aren't relevant to
someone getting started and only come into play further down the line.

Specificity is also important, if you've a highly specific question being able to ask someone in your or the wider
community is much more likely to result in a relevant answer than having to trawl through a bunch of search results or
long detailed documentation.

<!-- I'd used Git for version controlling my -->
<!-- code as a Medical Statistician but never worked with others using it. When I started doing so there were a number of -->
<!-- concepts that were completely new to me and my colleagues kindly took the time to explain them to me. -->

The key to a successful community really is about participation though and peer-to-peer interactions help promote this.

## Structure

+ Core Team of active members, inclusive and diverse.
+ Independent, bottom-up, self-governing, self-steering.
+ Not determined by institutional policies.
+ Collaborate with institutional Open Research programmes.
  <!-- + Library -->
  <!-- + FAIR Roadmap Working Group -->
  <!-- + [Data Visualisation Hub](https://dataviz.shef.ac.uk/) -->
+ All staff, researchers, support staff and administrators.

::: {.notes}
The structure of the Open Scholarship Community consists of a core team of active members which should be
inclusive and diverse, with members from all faculties represented. Members in specific domains are better positioned to
engage with and inspire their peers. It is important to have representatives from all faculties to encourage wide-spread
adoption and avoid any one group from feeling excluded or that Open Scholarship isn't for them. I've reached out to
members of the Open Research Working Group here at the University of Sheffield and have representatives from most
faculties but if you would like to be involved please do get in touch.

The community is meant to be an independent, bottom-up, self-governing and self-steering group and not determined by
institutional policies but should cooperate with the existing structures for Open Research such as the excellent
resources and meetings put on by Jenni Adams and her colleagues in the library, the Open Research Working Group who have
regular drop-in sessions. There is also the Data Visualisation Hub who help with analytical aspects and the RSE team
which I'm a part of who together with IT services run Code Clinics and Lunch Bytes.

Its aimed at all staff, not just researchers but support staff and administrators.

::: {.notes}
There are already a number of community activities in Sheffield. Jenni Adams, the library Open Research Manager and
organised or OpenFest2023, organises the monthly Open Research Conversations which are lunchtime seminars open to all
where typically two speakers discuss particular issues in open research followed by discussion.

Adam Partridge runs monthly drop-in sessions for those engaged in and interested in Open Research to discuss topics.

In the past Zuzzana XXX and Jim Uttley have organised local Reproducibilitea Journal Clubs where specific research
articles covering Open Research practices or examples of papers where such practices were discussed. These
tailed off around the pandemic but Zuzzana, Jim and myself are rejuvenating them and it would be great to have anyone
interested in learning more attending these.

Similarly there used to be the Sheffield R User Group which met to showcase using the R statistical software and
associated ecosystem for undertaking reproducible research. The frequency of these meetings varied but again tailed off
and haven't been run. Myself and Grace Accad of the Data Visualisation and Analysis Team are getting these back up and
running with a relaunch scheduled for October. We'd be keen to hear from you if you use R and have some work you would
like to present, but we'll have regular slots on using Quarto for different aspects of open research.

Most importantly though the community is shaped by you, if you've an interest or need to know more about a particualr
subject please come and join the community. If you've material on Open Research practices, whether that is
pre-registration, making your data Open and FAIR, reproducible writing, using the Open Science Framework or anything
that you might have shared with colleagues within your team or department please consider sharing it with the wider
community within the University.

The more people who participate the stronger and more supportive the community will be. And remember the community is
self-guiding so its activities and direction are meant to be guided by its members so please consider get involved.
